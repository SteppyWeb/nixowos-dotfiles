Here are my dotfiles for NixOs :)

I am a beginner so I don't know much about the NixOs language, nor much about any programing language for that matter, so things are probably very messy and unorganized.
I enjoyed using the niri wayland compositor when I was using arch and had a hard time figuring out how to have it in NixOs and almost gave up on it
but I managed to figure it out.  I was following tutorials and copying someone else's settings and it turns out that it was in conflict with enabling niri somehow. 
Also i didn't realize i wasn't connected to the internet so it wouldn't allow me to set up flakes.

this repo contains the packages that I have installed as well and it is not organized so alot of them are also in the configuration.nix file


I haven't been able to use dms-shell yet because I am having trouble trying to keep things on a stable branch while but ill probably figure it out later, or else I'll just switch to configuring something else.  
I am also confused about how it works with niri when the niri flake is not being used.

here are some helpful channels or videos about NixOs

TODO: 

get dms shell working or give up and configure something else
get shellAliases to update without reboot, don't know why they aren't updating anymore automatically
